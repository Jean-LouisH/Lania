[Lania](https://github.com/Jean-LouisH/Lania) is **a hobbyist 2D/3D game engine** specialized in Action Role Playing Games (ARPGs) for PC. 

It is named after the [Laniakea Supercluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laniakea_Supercluster). Laniakea is Hawaiian for "immeasurable heaven". This relates to the engine's representation of physical space and also the endlessness of its feature support for the future.
