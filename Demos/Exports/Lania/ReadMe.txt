Lania Debug Export ReadMe

This export folder contains no executable since it is only meant to be targeted by the debug build of Lania. 
That is, there is a compilation switch (or maybe even a console menu) in the debug build that will use the 
filepath to this folder from the debug folder. A release build, by design, will still work normally when copied to this folder.
